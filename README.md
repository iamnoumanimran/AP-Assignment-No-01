# AP-Assignment-No-01

I selected the October CMS for the following reasons:

1)	It is lightweight.
2)	It is efficient.
3)	It is built on Laravel Php framework.
4)	It is easier to use.
5)	It is very friendly to developers and clients.
6)	You can do everything in the admin area besides moving back and forth like in the WordPress OSS.
 
It is build on Php laravel framework so we require some localhost to use it. It requires PHP installed on your PC. I am using xammp for this purpose.
